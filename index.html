        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>This project was created with the hopes of helping this non-profit have more traction via their website. At first glance it was unclear what the mission statement or goal of this non-profit was. Through research discovery Angel Paws primary goal was narrow down to adoption services. This became the project focus as my team ideated, wireframed and protyped. Our finished redesign became a more focused, transparent, and inviting website compared to the original product. My hope after viewing this case study is that you come to the same conclusion. </p>

        <h3>THE PROMBLEM</h3>
        <p>Angel Paws adoption process was basically non-existent with minimal viewing and adoptions options on their original website. It was unclear what their focus was for their non-profit. There was no call to action or mission statement on their website. Low resolution images are utilized throughout the website. Transparency also raised an issue as it was unclear how to make a donation. </p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>We conducted an analysis of Angel Paws and other shelters and rescues, vets, and adoption service websites both locally and nationally to familiarize ourselves with the industry. We determined that fleshing out their adoption services on their website to be the most helpful improvement we could offer to Angel Paws. We did 4 recorded user interviews to gauge peopleâ€™s experiences, knowledge, and interest level about pet education, training, adoption, and ethics. We found out users need good photography of the animal, and they look for temperament, gender, and age the most to determine interest. We also determined through our interviews and survey results that most people have a negative experience adopting animals from shelters so we set out to improve their journey through the process as well. Our survey also made use of narrowing down the key features people look for when adopting a pet. </p>
